    My Homepage is a personal dashboard that allows users to have quick access
to their most frequently visited sites. Each user is allowed to create a profile
to store their specific preferences. This site is designed to be the starting point
for an online session, ideal for people that utilize multiple sites at once. This idea
was derived from the need to get my work session started as quickly as possible without
wasting time pulling up each individual website.

Features:
1. User Login- Each user has the ability to create a personal account which can be accessed by
    logging in with an email address & password. Each login attempt will be validated for security.

2. Link Storage- Once logged in, users have the ability to store links to their favorite websites.

3. Social Media Login- Users have the ability to login to their social media accounts with one click.

Technologies:

1. HTML5
2. CSS
3. Javascript
4. API's
5. MySQL
6. Node.js

    In order to achieve the desired results of the web application, I will need to learn how to use
data from a public API. Also, I'll need to find a way to store the data collected from each user.
